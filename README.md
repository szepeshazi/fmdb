# fmdb

The Fake Movie Database

## Summary

This is an example project to query a test API endpoint for movies and rendering them in a Flutter application.
The endpoint returns a list of movie objects as a JSON HTTP response, in an idempotent way (always returning the same movie
list).

The package demonstrates the use of popular Flutter packages, patterns and best practices. 
Although Flutter build target has been exclusively set for `web`, the project could easily target
other platforms (Android, iOS, etc) as well.
